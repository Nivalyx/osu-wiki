# Medals

Medals, previously known as *achievements*, are badges on a user's profile which indicate that the user has accomplished an exceptional goal. Currently, they are divided into 8 groups: [Beatmap Packs](#beatmap-packs), [Skill](#skill), [Dedication](#dedication), [Mod Introduction](#mod-introduction), [Hush-Hush](#hush-hush), [Beatmap Spotlights](#beatmap-spotlights), [Seasonal Spotlights](#seasonal-spotlights), and [Beatmap Challenge Packs](#beatmap-challenge-packs).

## Beatmap Packs

The **Beatmap Packs** medals can be obtained by **clearing every beatmap all the way through at least once in any difficulty** within the corresponding [Theme Beatmap Pack](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/packs?type=theme) or [Artist/Album Beatmap Pack](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/packs?type=artist). All beatmaps in the pack have to be cleared in the [osu!standard](/wiki/osu!standard) game mode in order to qualify for the badge unless otherwise specified. The usage of either [difficulty reduction mods](/wiki/Game_modifier#difficulty-reduction) or [difficulty increase mods](/wiki/Game_modifier#difficulty-increase) is permitted.

It is worth noting that . For the list of all the [Theme Beatmap Packs](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/packs?type=theme) in their legacy/original state, see [Legacy Beatmap Packs](/wiki/Medals/Legacy_Beatmap_Packs).

## Skill

The **Skill** medals are currently divided into three groups: Combo, High Ranker, and Star-based.

The Combo medals can be obtained by gaining a specific [combo](/wiki/combo) in osu!standard and can be completed with any one song. Achieving the same combo count in [osu!taiko](/wiki/osu!taiko), [osu!catch](/wiki/osu!catch), or [osu!mania](/wiki/osu!mania) mode will not result in getting the medal.

For the 1,000 and 2,000 combo medals, you should look for sufficiently long beatmaps. **If the beatmap is not in the Ranked or Approved state, the medals will not be granted.**

---

The High Ranker medals can be obtained by reaching a certain global ranking position in **any** game mode.

---

The star-based medals are split into two groups, *Pass* and *S*. The *Pass* medals can be obtained by passing a beatmap of a certain star difficulty (excluding EZ/NF/HT). The *S* medals will be granted if you meet the conditions of the *Pass* medal with a *S* ranking whilst also having an [FC](/wiki/FC). The difficulty of the beatmap will be rounded to the nearest star difficulty and will grant the medal for what it is rounded to. For example, if you have not earned the 6/7 star medals but cleared 7.8 stars difficulty, you will only receive a 7 star medal. You can also use difficulty increasing mods, such as HR/DT (based on increased stars). The beatmap must also be in the Ranked state to grant a medal.

## Dedication

The **Dedication** medals can be obtained by playing a lot of osu!standard, collecting many fruits in osu!catch, hitting getting a lot of drum hits in osu!taiko, by pressing a lot of keys in osu!mania.

## Mod Introduction

*See also: [Game Modifiers](/wiki/Game_modifier)*

The **Mod Introduction** medals can be obtained by clearing maps with the specified game modifier. They are meant to encourage newer players to try out each mod and explore what the game has to offer. Do note that if the player plays with multiple game modifiers at a time, the player is **not** eligible to earn *any* of the game modifier medals for that play.

## Hush-Hush

Medals of this kind have no obvious way to get them. The player must find out what needs to be done in order to unlock the medal. The title itself is a clue.
