# Medals

Medals, previously known as *achievements*, are badges on a user's profile which indicate certain goals that have been achieved by the user. Currently, there are **247** medals available to be unlocked across 8 different categories in total: [Beatmap Packs](#beatmap-packs), [Skill](#skill), [Dedication](#dedication), [Mod Introduction](#mod-introduction), [Hush-Hush](#hush-hush), [Beatmap Spotlights](#beatmap-spotlights), [Seasonal Spotlights](#seasonal-spotlights), and [Beatmap Challenge Packs](#beatmap-challenge-packs).

## Beatmap Packs

The **Beatmap Packs medals** are medals that are being awarded upon the completion of certain [Theme Beatmap Packs](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/packs?type=theme) or [Artist/Album Beatmap Packs](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/packs?type=artist). They can be obtained by clearing every beatmap all the way through at least once in any difficulty within the corresponding beatmap pack.

All beatmaps in the pack have to be cleared in the [osu!](/wiki/Game_mode/osu!) game mode in order to qualify for the badge unless otherwise specified. The usage of either [difficulty reduction mods](/wiki/Game_modifier#difficulty-reduction) or [difficulty increase mods](/wiki/Game_modifier#difficulty-increase) is permitted.

## Hush-Hush

The **Beatmap Packs medals** are "secret" medals that are being awarded upon pulling up certain specific feats, such as clearing a particular beatmap under some peculiar circumstances or setting down a score with an unusual mod combination. Although at first it may appear that there are no clear-cut instructions as to how the Hush-Hush medals could be unlocked, there are some hints that are being put around to guide all the curious medal hunters in their sleuth as follows:

- The name of the medals themselves,
- The medals' brief description, and
- The *flair text* <!-- https://twitter.com/ephemeralis/status/1068054191602638850 --> of the medals (if any), viewable by hovering over the corresponding medals' card.

As the Hush-Hush medals are meant to be a secret achievement of some sort, the list below will note out the *description and flair text* of the medals instead of the exact method of getting them. However, players are [welcomed to work together in order to figure out how to obtain all the Hush-Hush medals out there](https://osu.ppy.sh/home/news/2016-08-17-new-hush-hush-medals).
