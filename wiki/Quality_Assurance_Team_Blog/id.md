# Blog Quality Assurance Team

The **[Quality Assurance Team Blog](http://osuqat.tumblr.com)**, commonly referred to as the *QAT Blog*, was a semi-regular blog written by members of the [Quality Assurance Team](/wiki/Modding/Quality_Assurance_Team). Beginning in August of 2016, they discussed not only the activities of the QAT, but a variety of other topics spanning osu! gameplay, mapping, modding and the game/community as a whole.
