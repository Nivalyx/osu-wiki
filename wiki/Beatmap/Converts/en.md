# Converts

In osu! gameplay, **converts** (or *converted beatmaps*) are [beatmaps](/wiki//Beatmap) from a certain game mode that are in a different game mode it is not made for. All converts are automatically generated by the game based on certain parameters present on the original beatmap.

As it stands, osu! supports conversions of beatmaps from the [osu! game mode](/wiki/Game_mode/osu!) to osu!taiko, osu!catch, and osu!mania.

## Conversions

### osu! to osu!taiko conversion

*See also: [osu!taiko mapping/osu! conversion notes](/wiki/Game_mode/osu!taiko#osu!-conversion-notes)*

Converts between osu! and osu!taiko are generated according to the rhythms, hitsounds, and slider velocity changes present in the base beatmap. Depending on how objects are being hitsounded, the conversion between the two modes generally goes as follows:

- Circles, slider heads, slider tails, and slider repeats that bear no additive hitsounds (e.g. no whistle, clap, or finish) are converted as a *Don*.
- Circles slider heads, slider tails, and slider repeats that are hitsounded with whistle, clap, or a combination of both are converted as a *Katu*.
