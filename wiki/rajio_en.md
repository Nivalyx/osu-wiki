**rajio.ppy.sh**, often referred to as **rajio**, was a request-based online radio service ran and hosted by ::{ flag=AU }:: [peppy](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2) as a side project to osu! in 2008. It allowed people to queue up songs of their choice to be played in a global broadcast.

This revival only lasted briefly before
