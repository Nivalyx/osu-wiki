**rajio.ppy.sh**, often referred to as **rajio**, was a request-based online radio service ran and hosted by ::{ flag=AU }:: [peppy](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2) as a side project to osu! in 2008. It allowed people to queue up songs of their choice to be played in a global broadcast.

## Service

The way rajio functioned mirrors that of a contemporary Discord music bots such as [Ayana](https://ayana.io/) and [FredBoat](https://fredboat.com/). Upon visiting the website, users could search for songs from peppy's personal music database to be added into the radio's queue â€” this database was estimated to be around ~400 GB in size, mostly comprising of J-pop/anime/video game songs.
