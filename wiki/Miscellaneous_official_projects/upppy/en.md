**up.ppy.sh**, often referred to as **upppy**, was a file uploading service ran and hosted by ::{ flag=AU }:: [peppy](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2). It was first established in March 2007, predating osu! itself, and was primary used as a free, lightweight alternative for sharing images with the osu! community in spite of websites such as Rapidshare, Megaupload, and Imageshack.
