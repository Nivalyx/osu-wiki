**up.ppy.sh**, often referred to as **upppy**, was a file uploading service ran and hosted by ::{ flag=AU }:: [peppy](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2). It was first established in March 2007, predating osu! itself, and was primary used to share images and files within the osu! community.

## Service

upppy was created as a free, lightweight alternative to proprietary image hosting services such as Rapidshare or ImageShack.

## Decommissioning

As upppy relied upon [Adobe Flash Player](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adobe_Flash_Player) to upload user files, the upppy website was effectively rendered read-only starting from December 31, 2020 when [Adobe Flash Player was officially shut down](https://www.adobe.com/id_en/products/flashplayer/end-of-life-alternative.html). Sometime in early 2025, the entire website was taken down completely, leaving only an error page upon access.
