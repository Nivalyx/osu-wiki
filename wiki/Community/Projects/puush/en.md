**[puush.me](https://puush.me)**, often referred to as **puush**, is a file uploading service run and hosted by ::{ flag=AU }:: [peppy](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2). First launched in June 2010, the service serves as a successor to [upppy](/wiki/upppy) with a greater focus on screen sharing and user data management.

## Service

## Subscription

While puush is available to everyone free of charge, in order to keep the service self-sufficient, puush offers a "Pro" plan that users can subscribe to for US$15/year. This plan comes with a couple of extra benefits for the subscribing user, namely:

- Increased maximum filesize limit (20 MB for Free users vs. 250 MB for Pro users)
- Increased file retention period (1 months since last access for Free users vs. 6 months since last access for Pro users)

Similar to osu!, all puush users are not subjected to any ads regardless of their subscription status.

## Downscaling

Beginning in May 2014, puush no longer accepts registrations for the Pro plan as PayPal suspended puush's wire account due to a suspected Terms of Service breach. This prompted ::{ flag=AU }:: [peppy](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2) to concurrently pay out $500+ per month out of his own pocket to keep the service running, as puush's financials are independent from osu! and not tied to [supporter tag](/wiki/osu!supporter) purchases.

Later that year, in order to further make the service sustainable with minimal income revenue, puush disabled registrations for all new accounts altogether â€” although existing users may continue to use the service as usual.
