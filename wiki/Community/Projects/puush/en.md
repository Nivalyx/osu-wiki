**[puush.me](https://puush.me)**, often referred to as **puush**, is a file uploading service run and hosted by ::{ flag=AU }:: [peppy](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2). First launched in June 2010, the service serves as a successor to [upppy](/wiki/upppy) with a greater focus on screen sharing and user data management.

## Service

## Subscription

While puush is available to everyone free of charge, in order to keep the service self-sufficient, puush offers a "Pro" plan 

## Downscaling

Beginning in May 2014, puush no longer accepts registrations for Pro accounts as PayPal suspended puush's wire account due to a suspected Terms of Service breach. This prompted ::{ flag=AU }:: [peppy](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2) to concurrently pay out $500+ per month out of his own pocket to keep the service running, as puush's financials are independent from osu! and not tied to [supporter tag](/wiki/osu!supporter) purchases.

Later that year, in order to further make the service sustainable without user income backing, puush disabled registrations for all new accounts altogether â€” although existing users may continue to use the service as usual.
