# pTransl

**li.ppy.sh**, more commonly known as **pTransl**, was a community-based localisation platform ran and hosted by ::{ flag=AU }:: [peppy](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2). It was primarily used to enable members of the osu! community to localise the game to their own languages.

## Service

pTransl was launched in July 2009 and functioned similarly to that of localisation platforms such as [Crowdin](https://crowdin.com/).
