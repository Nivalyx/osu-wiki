# pTransl

**li.ppy.sh**, more commonly known as **pTransl**, was a community-based localisation platform ran and hosted by ::{ flag=AU }:: [peppy](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2). It was primarily used to enable members of the osu! community to localise the game into their own languages.

## Service

pTransl was launched in July 2009 and functioned similarly to that of localisation platforms such as [Crowdin](https://crowdin.com/). Upon registering, users could suggest translations of the game's [strings](https://localazy.com/dictionary/strings) into their native language or vote on existing suggestions from other users.

Suggestions were approved or denied into the game based on their vote count. Upon accumulating three positive upvotes, suggestions were considered to be "approved by the community" and subject to be added to the client's [localisation files](/wiki/Client/Program_files#localisation) in the next update. Similarly, suggestions with three negative downvotes were considered to be "denied" and would be hidden from the list of suggested translations.
