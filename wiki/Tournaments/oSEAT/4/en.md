5. In case a map ends with a score tie, **the player that doesn't pick the map** gets the point.
6. In case of a tiebreaker, each player will discreetly ban 1 of the 3 remaining available maps from the mappool. This is done by sending an in-game PM with your ban to the match referee. The one map that ends up not being banned by both players will be played as the tiebreaker.
   - If both players ban the same map, the referee will run the `!roll 2` command in the lobby to determine which of the 2 remaining tiebreakers will be played.
