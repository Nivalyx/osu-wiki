![Group Stage bracket scheme](img/group-stage-bracket.jpg)

3. The winner of A5 and A9 on each group will advance to the Knock-out stages in the Upper Bracket as the group's winner and runner-up respectively, while the loser of A9 and the winner of A8 will advance to the Knock-out stages in the Lower Bracket accordingly as the 3rd-placed and the 4th-placed player in the group.

### Knock-out stage rules

1. The 64 players who managed to get through from the Group Stage will be matched to each other based on their Group Stage placement as described above.

   - Players who lose in the Upper Bracket can still play again on the Lower Bracket.
   - Players who lose in the Lower Bracket will be eliminated from the tournament.
   - In the Grand Finals, the winner of the the Upper Bracket only needs to win a single match against their opponent in order to claim the championship title.

### Match regulations

1. Each player must use the `!roll` command once in the multiplayer lobby in order to determine the banning and picking order.
   - The winner of the `!roll` gets to determine who gets the first pick and the second ban.
   - The loser of the `!roll` gets the opposite by default.
   - This rule does not apply in the Qualifier lobbies.
2. Each player has to ban **one beatmap** (on Group Stage) and **two beatmaps** (on the Knock-out stages) from the mappool. These beatmaps are not allowed to be picked by any player during the entire match.
   - Each player may not ban two maps from the same modpool in a single match.
   - Banning does not apply in the Qualifier lobbies.
3. **There will be no warm-up beatmaps to be played in the multiplayer lobby.** Players who are looking up to warm themselves up before the match are expected to do so by their own outside the multiplayer lobby.
4. In a FreeMod pick, each player has to apply at least one mod to play the map with. Allowed mods are EZ, HR, HD, FL, or any possible combinations of the four mods.
   - Playing a FreeMod pick without any mods activated is not allowed.
5. In case a map ends with a score tie, **the player that doesn't pick the map** gets the point.
6. In case of a tiebreaker, each player will discreetly ban 1 of the 3 remaining available maps from the mappool. This is done by sending an in-game PM with your ban to the match referee. The one map that ends up not being banned by both players will be played as the tiebreaker.
   - If both players ban the same map, the referee will run the `!roll 2` command in the lobby to determine which of the 2 remaining possible tiebreakers will be played.
7. The results of each match and any other relevant information regarding the match will be posted on the Discord server after the match has been concluded by the responsible referees.
