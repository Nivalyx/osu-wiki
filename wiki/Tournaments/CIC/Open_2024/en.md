## Ruleset

### General rules

1. Match lobbies across the tournament will adhere to the following room settings:
   - Team Mode: `Head-to-head`
   - Win Condition: [`ScoreV2`](/wiki/Gameplay/Score#scorev2)
2. The mappools for each round will be announced by the tournament management in advance before the actual matches take place.
3. Match schedules will be predetermined by the tournament management. If there are any players who are unable to attend the current schedule for any reason, all other affected players may apply and settle for a reschedule at the `#reschedule-request` channel in the tournament's Discord server.
4. A referee will create a multiplayer room 10 minutes in advance and will start to send out invites.
5. If a player does not show up within **10 minutes** of the scheduled start time, their opponent wins by default.
6. If no staff or referee is available, the match will be postponed.
7. **NoFail will be enforced in all beatmaps.** This is to ensure that the points are to be awarded more fairly towards players who perform better in general during the course of the beatmap regardless of their remaining health at the end.
8. If a player disconnects, it will be treated as if they had failed the beatmap.
   - A beatmap can be replayed for disconnects that occur within 30 seconds after it has been started or prior to 25% of its completion.
9. Lag is not a valid reason to nullify a beatmap.
10. If any problems during the match occur, the tournament management will make a decision based on the referee's report.
11. It is expected that all players be polite and respectful to each other. Penalties will be given upon violation.
    - If a player is found to be engaging in an act that is deemed to be distasteful or provocative, the corresponding player may be disqualified right away from the tournament and/or blacklisted from future iterations of the tournament by the tournament management.
    - Usage of any tools or programs that are against the [osu! community rules](/wiki/Rules#community-rules) is strictly prohibited and will be straight up reported to the osu! team at will.

### Tournament registration

1. In order to participate, players are required to register into the tournament through [the tournament's website](https://wybin.xyz/tournaments/catch-indonesia-cup-open-2024/home).
   - Each player is required to be geographically based in or around the [Asia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asia) or [Oceania](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oceania) region.
   - For the sake of simplification, regions of certain transcontinental countries such as ::{ flag=AZ }:: Azerbaijan or ::{ flag=RU }:: Russia that extends to the Asian continent are considered as a part of Asia.
2. To ensure that all incoming registrations are serious and valid, every registered player will be checked in detail by the tournament management.
3. The list of players who are deemed to be eligible to compete in the tournament will be published by the tournament management after the registration phase has ended.
4. Testplayers, referees, and mappool selectors may not participate as players in this tournament.

### Round-specific rules

#### Qualifier rules

1. Each player will have to sign up to one of the Qualifier lobbies that have been scheduled and prepared by the tournament management in advance.
2. In the lobby, all players will have to consecutively play all of the ten Qualifier beatmaps in the order of NM1 -> NM2 -> NM3 -> HD1 -> HD2 -> HR1 -> HR2 -> DT1 -> DT2 -> EZ1.
3. Players **are not allowed** to ban any beatmaps in the Qualifiers.
4. Players **are not allowed** to join (or register for) more than one Qualifier lobby.
5. Based on their performance in the Qualifier, players will be ranked based on their **total %MAX value** aggregated from each individual Qualifier beatmap.
   - The %MAX value for a beatmap is calculated according to the following equation: `%MAX = (Player Score / Max. Achievable Score)`
6. 32 players with the **highest total %MAX value** according to the above criteria will advance to the knock-out stages.
   - If there are two (or more) players that share the same total %MAX value, the players will be ordered based on their average score across all ten Qualifier beatmaps.
7. Failure to attend in any of the predetermined Qualifier lobbies will result in an instant elimination from the tournament.

#### Knock-out stage rules

1. The 32 players who got through from the Qualifiers will be matched against each other based on their Qualifier seeding (e.g. Seed #1 vs. Seed #32, Seed #2 vs. Seed #31, and so on).
2. Players will compete against each other using the double-elimination system.
3. The double-elimination system works as follows:
   - Players who lose in the upper bracket can still play again in the lower bracket.
   - Players who lose in the lower bracket will be eliminated from the tournament.
   - In the Grand Final, the winner of the the upper bracket will only need to win a single match in order to claim the championship title. The winner of the lower bracket, however, will need to win two matches and enforce a *bracket reset* in order to clinch the championship title.
4. Players who can compete in the next round are determined by:
   - In the Round of 32 and the Round of 16, each player needs to win 5 points in order to win a match. (Best of 9)
   - In the Quarterfinals and the Semifinals, each player needs to win 6 points in order to win a match. (Best of 11)
   - In both of the Finals weeks, each player needs to win 7 points in order to win a match. (Best of 13)
   - Whether there are players who are declared to win the match by default.
   - Whether there are players who are disqualified from the tournament.

### Match regulations

1. Prior to starting the match, representatives from each player must run the `!roll` command in order to determine the banning and picking order.
   - The winner of the `!roll` gets to determine who gets the first pick and the second ban.
   - The loser of the `!roll` gets the opposite by default.
   - This rule does not apply in the Qualifier lobbies.
2. Each player has to ban **one beatmap** from the corresponding mappool. These beatmaps will not be allowed to be picked by any player during the entire match.
   - Barring the tiebreaker, there are no restrictions as to which maps may and may not be banned in a match.
3. Each player will be given a chance to pick **one warm-up beatmap** to be played in the lobby.
   - Playing a warm-up beatmap is not mandatory, and players may elect to skip their warm-up pick should they wish to. 
4. Maps from the same mod pool **may not be picked twice in a row**.
   - For example, following a NM1 pick, the next player picking may not pick another map from the No Mod pool.
5. When playing a map from the HardRock or DoubleTime pool, the Hidden modification may be optionally used by any player.
6. In the case of a tiebreaker, the tiebreaker map will be played with the FreeMod option enabled. Players are free to play the tiebreaker map with the Hidden mod should they wish to.
   - Playing the tiebreaker map with a mod is *not* mandatory.
7. The results of each match and any other relevant information regarding the match will be noted by the referee after the match has been concluded.
