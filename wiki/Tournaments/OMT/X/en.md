6. If no staff or referee is available, the match will be postponed.

   - In such cases, the beatmap result will be given to whichever team had a distinct advantage score-wise up to the disconnection.

    - Usage of any tools or programs that are against the [osu! community rules](/wiki/Rules#community-rules) is strictly prohibited and will be straight up reported to the osu! team at will.

### Tournament registration

1. In order to participate, players are required to form a team of around 4â€“6 players and register into the tournament as a team through [this form](https://forms.gle/1EoZ7GF8mrSaQ7pG7).

   - The tournament specifically employs a new, modified "badge decay system" that takes into account the age of each badge in its BWS calculations. Details on this system can be found [on this document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1FWQdDcTbiCzijoE-cU0pj6r--gZzv0N3vD0_a49u6yA/edit#heading=h.fh2l58wew9t8).
2. Each team has to submit a designated team captain and a team name to the tournament management before the end of the screening phase.
   - Teams are encouraged to choose their names carefully. The tournament management is not responsible for any repercussions that may arise from team names.
3. Team captains are required to be present at the tournament's [Discord server](https://discord.gg/Tr9ZC97rwv) as long as their team are still playing in the tournament.
4. To ensure that all incoming registrations are serious and valid, every registered player will be checked in detail by the tournament management.
5. The list of players and teams who are deemed to be eligible to compete in the tournament will be published by the tournament management after the registration phase has ended.
6. Testplayers, referees, and mappool selectors may not participate as players in this tournament.
   - Eliminated players are free to enlist as replay providers for the later stages of the tournament in accordance to the [official tournament support guidelines](/wiki/Tournaments/Official_support#staff). 

### Round-specific rules

#### Qualifier rules

1. Each team will have to sign up to one of the Qualifier lobbies that have been scheduled and prepared by the tournament management in advance.
2. In the lobby, all teams will have to consecutively play all of the ten Qualifier beatmaps in the order of NM1 -> NM2 -> NM3 -> NM4 -> HD1 -> HD2 -> HR1 -> HR2 -> DT1 -> DT2.
3. Teams **are not allowed** to ban any beatmaps in the Qualifiers.
4. Teams **are not allowed** to join (or register for) more than one Qualifier lobby.
5. Based on their performance in the Qualifier, teams will be ranked based on their average rank combined from each individual Qualifier beatmap.
6. 32 teams with the **highest average rank** according to the above criteria will advance to the knock-out stages.
   - If there are two (or more) teams that share the same average rank, the teams will be ordered based on their average score across all ten Qualifier beatmaps.
   - If the teams are still tied on average score, teams will then be ordered based on the average ranking of their roster after BWS calculations.
7. Failure to attend in any of the predetermined Qualifier lobbies will result in an instant elimination from the tournament.

#### Knock-out stage rules

1. The 32 teams who got through from the Qualifiers will be matched against each other based on their Qualifier seeding (e.g. Seed #1 vs. Seed #32, Seed #2 vs. Seed #31, and so on).
2. Teams will compete against each other using the double-elimination system.
3. The double-elimination system works as follows:
   - Teams who lose in the upper bracket can still play again in the lower bracket.
   - Teams who lose in the lower bracket will be eliminated from the tournament.
   - In the Grand Final match, the winner of the the upper bracket will only need to win a single match in order to claim the championship title. The winner of the lower bracket, however, will need to win two matches and enforce a *bracket reset* in order to clinch the championship title.
4. Teams who can compete in the next round are determined by:
   - In the Round of 32 and the Round of 16, each team needs to win 5 points in order to win a match. (Best of 9)
   - In the Quarterfinals and the Semifinals, each team needs to win 6 points in order to win a match. (Best of 11)
   - In the Finals[^stage-note-1] onwards, each team needs to win 7 points in order to win a match. (Best of 13)
   - Whether there are teams who are declared to win the match by default.
   - Whether there are teams who are disqualified from the tournament.

### Match regulations

1. Prior to starting the match, representatives from each team must run the `!roll` command in order to determine the banning and picking order.
   - The winner of the `!roll` gets to determine who gets the first pick and the second ban.
   - The loser of the `!roll` gets the opposite by default.
   - This rule does not apply in the Qualifier lobbies.
2. Each team has to ban **two beatmaps** from the corresponding mappool. These beatmaps will not be allowed to be picked by any team during the entire match.
   - The bans will be done alternatingly (Aâ€“Bâ€“Aâ€“B) between the two teams.
   - Barring the tiebreaker, there are no restrictions as to which maps may or may not be banned in a match.
3. Each team will be given a chance to pick **one warm-up beatmap** (up to 4:30 max) to be played in the lobby.
   - Playing a warm-up beatmap is not mandatory, and teams may elect to skip their warm-up pick should they wish to.
4. Teams are expected to exercise common sense in pick time windows.
   - If a team is unable to come up with a pick within a 90-second time window of their picking turn, the pick will be given to the other team.
5. In a Free Mod pick, each team has to field **at least two different mod combinations** to play the beatmap with.
   - No Mod does not count as an unique mod combination.
   - Hard Rock and Hidden + Hard Rock counts as the same mod combination.
   - There are no bonus score multipliers for players who are playing with either Easy or Flashlight.
6. In the case of a tiebreaker, the tiebreaker map will be played with the Free Mod option enabled.
   - Playing the tiebreaker map with a mod is *not* mandatory.
7. The results of each match and any other relevant information regarding the match will be noted by the referee after the match has been concluded.
