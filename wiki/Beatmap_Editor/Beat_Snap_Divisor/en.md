# Beat snap divisor

![Beat Snap Divisor in the editor](img/beat_snap_divisor.png)

The **Beat Snap Divisor** is a built-in editor functionality that ensures every [hit objects](/wiki/Hit_Object) are placed proportionally to the song's beats. It can be found in the upper-right portion of the editor screen, where it corresponds to the granularity of the objects on the [editor timeline](/wiki/Beatmap_Editor/Timelines); that is, a denser Beat Snap Divisor setting allows for more notes can be placed in the same measure and vice versa. 

The osu! editor supports eleven different Beat Snap Divisor settings as follows:

## 1/1 snap divisor

![1/1 snap divisor in the osu!mania editor's timeline](/wiki/shared/1_1_m.jpg "1/1 snap divisor in the osu!mania editor's timeline")

The 1/1 snap divisor allows for hit objects to be placed on every *full beats*. It is being represented by the white-coloured ticks in the editor timeline.

Due to its simplicity and ease of use, this snap divisor is most commonly used while mapping Easy difficulties.

## 1/2 snap divisor

The 1/2 snap divisor allows for hit objects to be placed on every *half beats* and its multiples (e.g. 1/2). It is being represented by the red-coloured ticks in the editor timeline.

## 1/3 snap divisor

The 1/3 snap divisor allows for hit objects to be placed on *triplets*, which is the third fraction of a beat and its multiples (e.g. 1/3 and 2/3). It is being represented by the purple-coloured ticks in the editor timeline.

Although not common, some music genres (e.g. swing jazz) often exhibits a heavy use of 1/3 snap divisor.

## 1/4 snap divisor

The 1/4 snap divisor allows for hit objects to be placed on every *quarter beats*, which is the fourth fraction of a beat and its multiples (e.g. 1/4 and 3/4). It is being represented by the blue-coloured ticks in the editor timeline.

Due to its versatility, this snap divisor is extremely popular among mappers and is frequently used in all sorts of maps in general. It is also the default setting given by the editor upon importing a new audio file.

## 1/5 snap divisor

The 1/5 snap divisor allows for hit objects to be placed on every fifth fraction of a beat and its multiples (e.g. 1/5, 2/5, 3/5, and 4/5). It is being represented by the yellow-coloured ticks in the editor timeline.

This snap divisor is extremely uncommon out there and should be used with extreme care; in case you find yourself resorting to 1/5 snap divisor on your map while being uncertain about whether its usage is proper or not, it is recommended for you to seek further advice from experienced mappers.

The 1/3 and 1/6 are special because it means your BPM is divisible by three, but this is *rare*.
