# Beat Snap Divisor

![Beat Snap Divisor in the editor](img/beat_snap_divisor.png)

The **Beat Snap Divisor** is a built-in editor functionality that ensures every [hit objects](/wiki/Hit_Object) are placed proportionally to the song's beats. It can be found in the upper-right portion of the editor screen, where it corresponds to the granularity of the objects on the [editor timeline](/wiki/Beatmap_Editor/Timelines); that is, a denser Beat Snap Divisor setting allows for more notes can be placed in the same measure and vice versa. 

The osu! editor supports eleven different Beat Snap Divisor settings as follows:

## 1/1 snap divisor

The 1/1 snap divisor allows for hit objects to be placed on every *full beats*. It is being represented by the white-coloured ticks on the editor timeline.

Due to its simplicity and ease of use, this snap divisor is most commonly used while mapping Easy difficulties.

## 1/2 snap divisor

![1/2 snap divisor in the osu!mania editor](/wiki/shared/1_2_m.jpg "1/2 snap divisor in the osu!mania editor")

The 1/2 snap divisor allows for hit objects to be placed on every *half beats* and its multiples (e.g. 1/2). It is being represented by the red-coloured ticks on the editor timeline.

## 1/3 snap divisor

![1/3 snap divisor in the osu!mania editor](/wiki/shared/1_3_m.jpg "1/3 snap divisor in the osu!mania editor")

The 1/3 snap divisor allows for hit objects to be placed on *triplets*, which is the third fraction of a beat and its multiples (e.g. 1/3 and 2/3). It is being represented by the purple-coloured ticks on the editor timeline.

Although relatively rare, there are some songs and music genres out there (e.g. swing jazz) that are being assembled primarily in the 1/3 snap divisor.

## 1/4 snap divisor
