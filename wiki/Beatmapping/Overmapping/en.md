# Overmapping

**Overmapping** is a term used when [hit objects](/wiki/Gameplay/Hit_object) or arrangement of hit objects are mapped in a way that makes the [difficulty](/wiki/Beatmap/Difficulty) of the beatmap contrast the song.

This is usually done by adding unnecessarily large [jumps](/wiki/Beatmap/Pattern/osu!/Jump), [slider velocity](/wiki/Gameplay/Hit_object/Slider/Slider_velocity) changes, or by mapping to inaudible or non-existant sounds (i.e. adding notes on blue ticks when the song uses red ticks).

Please note that while overmapping is generally discouraged upon,
