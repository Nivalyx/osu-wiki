# Overmapping

In beatmapping, **overmapping** is a mapping technique where [hit objects](/wiki/Gameplay/Hit_object) are deliberately placed at a much higher contrast compared to what the song (or the rest of the map) conceivably calls for.

This is mainly done by mapping to inaudible or non-existant sounds (i.e. adding notes on blue ticks when the song only uses red ticks). Less frequently, overmapping can also be achieved by adding exorbitantly large [jumps](/wiki/Beatmap/Pattern/osu!/Jump) or sliders with very high [slider velocity](/wiki/Gameplay/Hit_object/Slider/Slider_velocity).

Please note that while overmapping is generally discouraged, this technique remains perfectly acceptable to use when applied under an appropriate context.
