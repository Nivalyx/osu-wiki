The Indonesian osu! community is no stranger to LAN tournaments. 

## Tournament

The main event of the space is the **osu! Philippines Quickfire Showdown 2023**. A lineup of confirmed players will go through a LAN tournament featuring a *Super Smash Bros.*–styled brawl format. The tournament will take place on day 1 and day 2, with prizes in store!

For more information about the tournament, refer to [this wiki article](/wiki/Tournaments/oPQS/2).

## Booth activities

The tournament isn't the only thing that's in store for the attendees! If the burning flames of the competition is not their thing, there are other activities as well: for community members that want to meet up with their friends or for those meeting for the first time, this is their chance to create new memories and friends at the booth's Player Hub! Newcomers and those already familiar with the game will also be able to play osu!(lazer) at the booth as well.

In addition to this, [BTMC](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3171691) will also be present in the convention as one of its guests!

If you want to keep up with the event as it unfolds but can't attend the convention, watch the livestreamed content on the [osu! Philippines Twitch channel](https://twitch.tv/osuliveph).

See you there — whether on stream or in person!
